Hello, this is the readme file.

Program by Drake Sorkhab, Sep 2022.

Goals for future features:
-Each time the program is run, it PERMANENTLY corrects the tone symbols by overwriting the "data.txt" file
-Tracking which flashcards were right/wrong last time? So that you can choose to review only those
-Separating radicals and words?
-A huge bank of words scrubbed from a website put in (the program doesn't have to do this automatically, I could do it manually)
-When the special only flashcards are displayed (input like "s5"), the number before each one should be its regular number (i.e. it won't necessarily go 0,1,2 but could be 34,51,56)
