Hello, this is the readme file.

Program by Drake Sorkhab, Sep 2022.

Goals for future features:
-Each time the program is run, it PERMANENTLY corrects the tone symbols by overwriting the "data.txt" file
-The program also allows you to type the tone at the end of syllables (how Chinese people normally do it). I.e. "hao3" instead of "ha3o". This is more ambitious since the program would need a list of diphthongs or recognize when two cowels occur in a row
-Tracking which flashcards were right/wrong last time? So that you can choose to review only those
-Separating radicals and words?
-A huge bank of words scrubbed from a website put in (the program doesn't have to do this automatically, I could do it manually)
-When the special only flashcards are displayed (input like "s5"), the number before each one should be its regular number (i.e. it won't necessarily go 0,1,2 but could be 34,51,56)



I like to use this website to find radicals:

Maybe try this one?
